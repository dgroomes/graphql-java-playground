# graphql-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring _GraphQL_ and _GraphQL Java_

## Description

I've been sleeping on GraphQL for years but it has only exploded in popularity, feature richness and I think overall
goodness. I need to learn it. This project is me doing that.

## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

### `sdl/`

A simple Java program that uses GraphQL to echo a message back to the user. The schema is defined in an SDL file.

See the README in [sdl/](sdl/).
