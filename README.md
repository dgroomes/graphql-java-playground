NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring _GraphQL_ and _GraphQL Java_

## Description

I've been sleeping on GraphQL for years but it has only exploded in popularity, feature richness and I think overall
goodness. I need to learn it. This project is me doing that.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run the app:

1. Use Java 17
1. Build and run the app:
    * `./gradlew run`

## TODO

* Write a simple GraphQL Java program that uses GraphQL Java
    * Generate some test data procedurally and store in in memory (a simple Map)
    * Write the GraphQL schema file
    * Write the GraphQL boilerplate code
* Example requests
    * This is an illustrative program that should be invoked from the command line. Make some example GraphQL requests
      by passing them as string arguments to the program. 

## Notes

While GraphQL is usually implemented in a web services context, there's no stopping you from using it another context
like a CLI or a desktop application.
